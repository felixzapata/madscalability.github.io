Every piece of software that is running in their warehouses (aka _hives_) was developed internally. They decided not to go with multitenant and certain critical services are deployed directly in the hive, also, they didn’t discard running a local instance of Kubernetes within their hives theirselves. If you want to know more about their architecture, how do they manage deployments in more than one warehouse, the why behind some decisions and every step they took to reach this point, we encourage you to come!\n\nPS: they promise to show some numbers about what all this machinery is doing while you sleep!","video":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAFktSf6m_0","language":"ES","date":"23/10/2019"}},"__N_SSG":true}
