{"pageProps":{"meetup":{"title":"Incident analysis","speakers":[{"name":"Alejandro Fern√°ndez","role":"Freelance","twitter":"pinchito"}],"abstract":"Our website is down! Customers are complaining! The sky is falling on our heads! What can we do to improve the situation? If we are managing a team, should we start cutting off heads? Otherwise, should we start looking for a new job?\nDo not despair; we are not alone, we have many decades of incident analysis behind us. In this talk we will explain several techniques that may help us face the situation: root-cause analysis, the five whys and blameless postmortems. We will also review some leadership attitudes and how they affect future incident response. Finally, we will briefly analyze a couple of real catastrophes from recent history that will give us a fresh perspective on incident analysis.","video":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g274h7w0TTk","language":"EN","date":"23/09/2020"}},"__N_SSG":true}
